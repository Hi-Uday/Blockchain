# Essential Info
In this project I took 3 contracts...
1. For University
2. For Students
3. For Certificate
I am using multilevel inheritance here so that each child has some required properties of parent node.
So, I created one contract for University where it take details of particular University,
Next I created one student contract which take University as a parent node 
Lastly, I take certificate contract which take student as parent node
Basically I have University->Students->Certificate
